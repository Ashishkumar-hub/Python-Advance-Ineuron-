It does this without making needless copies of data and which leads to efficient algorithm implementations. There are cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slow down the computation.\n",

Numpy guarantees swift execution as it is accumulated with mathematical and numerical functions. Robust Python with its dynamic data structures, efficient implementation of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, Numpy assures accurate calculations with matrices and arrays. We need to import Numpy into memory to perform numerical operations. There are other libraries also like pandas,scipy etc which makes working in python more easy."
