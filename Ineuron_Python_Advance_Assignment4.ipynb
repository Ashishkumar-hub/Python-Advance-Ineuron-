        "One of the most significant differences between MongoDB and Cassandra is their strategy concerning data availability. This feature dependents on the number of master slaves in a cluster. MongoDB has a single master directing multiple slave nodes. Cassandra, on the other hand, uses a different model.\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer: Cassandra works with peer to peer architecture, with each node connected to all other nodes. Each Cassandra node performs all database operations and can serve client requests without the need for a master node. A Cassandra cluster does not have a single point of failure as a result of the peer-to-peer distributed architecture. Example: Netflix uses cassandra.\n",

        "Seeds: Each node configures a list of seeds which is simply a list of other nodes. A seed node is used to bootstrap a node when it is first joining a cluster. A seed does not have any other specific purpose, and it is not a single point of failure. A node does not require a seed on subsequent restarts after bootstrap. It is recommended to use two to three seed nodes per Cassandra data center, and keep the seeds list uniform across all the nodes. \n",
        "\n",
        "Gossip: Gossip is the protocol used by Cassandra nodes for peer-to-peer communication. The gossip informs a node about the state of all other nodes. A node performs gossip with up to three other nodes every second. The gossip messages follow specific format and version numbers to make efficient communication."

Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state."
